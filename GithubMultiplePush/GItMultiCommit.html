        <li> <b>Football</b>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Lionel Messi</li>
                <p>He's been at the top football player for nearly a decade, but he's still holding strong at the age of 33. In fact, he's become accustomed to having spectacular statistics and performances. In spite of dropping Barcelona's first four tournaments due to injury, Messi is on track to win La Liga best scorer for the seventh time in his football player journey, with 22 goals till date and three games remaining.</p>
                <li>Cristiano Ronaldo</li>
                <p>One of the top footballers is of 35 years of age, only in his season 2 in Italy, and is still putting up outrageous figures in front of goal. The top football player has scored half of Juventus' goals in all competitions this time, with 28 goals and 6 assists in 28 league games and in totality of 39 goal contribution in all competitions.</p>
                
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Basketball</b>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar<li>
                    <p> Kareem put up a whopping 38,387 points during his playing days, I can’t look past the fact that he spent a good chunk of his career receiving passes from Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson, the two greatest point guards of all time.</p>
                <li>Tim Duncan</li>
                <p>In his prime, Duncan, nicknamed “The Big Fundamental” by no less a nickname authority than Shaquille O’Neal, was one of the most sound players of all time. While his famously vanilla playing style and quiet demeanor kept him from having a cultural impact similar to the other greats, his four championships, 14 All-Star Games, and two NBA MVP awards are indisputable evidence of his fantastic ability.</p>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Hockey</b>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Grahanandan Singh</li>
                <p>Grahanandan Singh was part of the Indian squad that won back-to-back gold medals in the 1948 and 192 Olympics. The former Vice President of the Asian Hockey Federation played one match each in both campaigns to secure two gold medals for himself. In the 1948 Olympics in London, Singh featured in a preliminary round match against Spain that India won 2-0. In the following Olympics in Helsinki Singh again played only one match, a semi-final clash against Great Britain that India won 3-1.</p>
                <li>Keshav Dutt</li>
                <p>Considered to be one of the best centre half-backs to play for India, Keshav Dutt was a teammate of Grahanandan Singh. He has two Olympic gold medals to his name which he won in India’s triumph in the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. The halfback made 22 international appearances for India in a career that spanned nine years. Keshav Dutt was also the first non-footballer to receive the Mohun Bagan award back in 2019.</p>

        <li><b>Kho-Kho</b>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Satish Rai</li>
                <p>Satish Rai is one of the most famous kho-kho players. Very little is known about him except for his excellent gaming skills. He was a tough, fit dedicated, and attentive player.  In 2010, the newly formed Kho-Kho Federation of India had decided to conduct a Kho-Kho World Series on similar lines to the Baseball World Series in America. A bunch of Kho-Kho enthusiasts decided to support the federation and draw attention to the age-old sport. Satish Rai was an active enthusiast in promoting and supporting the series speaking to media about the benefits of the plan.
                    Moreover, Satish Rai is the most important and stupendous Indian Kho Kho player. He is a predominant player. He played for many years and won many medals</p>
                <li>Sarika Kale</li>
                <p>Sarika Kale, captain of India’s women’s kho-kho team recently led the national team to clinch a gold at the 12th South Asian Games (SAG) in Guwahati.

                    At the age of 10, Sarika began playing kho-kho and developed an interest in the game. With time, she mastered the skills of the game and represented her state Maharashtra in 25 national championships.
                    
                    In 2016, the renowned kho-kho player was struggling to find a job. The Railways had a men’s kho-kho team but were yet to recruit a female kho-kho player. On this Devarajan, an Olympian and Arjuna awardee, who won the bronze medal at the 1994 Boxing World Cup in Bangkok said
                    
                   <i> “The Indian Kho-Kho Federation (IKKF) has requested them to recruit Sarika and a few other players, but it’s a matter of policy and we need approval from the Railway Board which we are awaiting.”</i>
                    
                    Sarika has always been confident that her sport, just like kabaddi, will grow leaps and bounds if the corporate sector steps in.</p>
